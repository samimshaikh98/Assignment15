    "A database is a structured collection of data that is stored and organized in a way that allows efficient retrieval and manipulation of the data. Databases are used to store data for a wide variety of applications, such as websites, business systems, and scientific research.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two main types of databases: SQL (relational) and NoSQL (non-relational) databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are also known as relational databases. They use tables to store data, and the relationships between tables are defined by keys. SQL databases are widely used for traditional business applications and are known for their ability to handle complex transactions and large data sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, Microsoft SQL Server, and PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL (non-relational) databases are designed to handle unstructured data, such as documents, key-value pairs, or graphs. They do not use tables to store data, and there is no predefined schema. NoSQL databases are often used for web and mobile applications, social networks, and other applications that require scalability and flexibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Couchbase, Cassandra, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main differences between SQL and NoSQL databases are:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Data model: SQL databases have a predefined schema, while NoSQL databases are schemaless.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Query language: SQL databases use the SQL query language, while NoSQL databases use a variety of query languages, including JSON-based query languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Scalability: NoSQL databases are designed to scale horizontally, which means they can handle large amounts of data and traffic by adding more servers to the system. SQL databases are designed to scale vertically, which means they can handle larger amounts of data and traffic by adding more powerful hardware to the system.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Transactions: SQL databases are known for their ability to handle complex transactions, while NoSQL databases are optimized for speed and scalability, and may not support transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific needs of the application. SQL databases are a good choice for applications that require complex transactions and data consistency, while NoSQL databases are a good choice for applications that require scalability and flexibility."

    "In a relational database, a primary key is a column or set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It is a constraint that ensures that the values in the primary key column(s) are unique and not null. A primary key can be a single column or a combination of columns.\n",
